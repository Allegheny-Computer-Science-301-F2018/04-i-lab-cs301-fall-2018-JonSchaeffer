##Question 7.
The small pox vaccine has a similiar success rate compared to measles. It appears that the same stigma around vaccines is attached to small pox. While trying to find sources, I stumbled on
websites that "claim" the small pox vaccine has too many side effects that outweigh the vaccine itself. Before a small pox vaccine existed, the morality rate was around 30%. Edward Jenner would be
the person to develop a small pox vaccine and within 10 years eradicated. The telegraph claims it is the most successful vaccine to date due to how quickly the threat of small pox was eliminated. I got
my information from the (telegraph)[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/8267935/Smallpox-the-most-successful-vaccination-ever.html] and I believe the source to be credible because a.) they are a legit newsource and b.) they weren't trying to use pseudo science to manipulate data in any way.

##Question 8.

8a.) The damage done to public medicine is that now a distrust is formed between the public and public medicine. A lot of people who choose to believe vaccines cause autism have a distrust with doctors
and academics because the person who wrote the inaccurate article was "forced" to redact it. It just adds fuel to the fire.

8b.) Any research should be properly vetted before it is released into public domain - especially if you are a licensed doctor or an academic at a college/university. Accountability has to be instituted
to ensure the high standards of doctors and academics remains high. It's kind of like how if you submit a bug fix to the linux kernel it goes through many different eyes and will see it's way through to
the main linux developers to get approval so the bug fix will be in the new kernel release. It would be silly to throw random people's bug fixes into a kernel that supports millions of devices. If that
happened, many people would distrust linux and it's developers and stop using the OS. The same principle applies to properly vetting research papers/reports.

8c.) I don't believe that the retraction of the paper is enough to fix the damage of public medicine. Honestly, I don't think the damage will ever be fixed. The groups who still choose to believe
vaccines cause things like autism are looking for a scapegoat to blame for their child not being 100% healthy. Once that scapegoat entered the public, no matter how much research that comes out
to disprove the redacted paper, those people will still deny it and point to the false paper because it is something they can point their finger at and blame.

##Question 9.
One dataset that would be helpful is the World Healthy Survey. This survey spans over 70 countries and over 300,000 individuals. This information could be used to compare third world countries who don't
have access to vaccines to first world countries that do have vaccines. The health could be compared to see if the overall health/morality rate is better or worse in first/third world countries. If the
first world countries have better health/morality over third world countries, you may be able to deduce that having vaccines is curcial to individual health. A second database that would be helpful
is the WHO Morality Database. You can see the cause of death of an individual. You could filter out the deaths that include diseases that are cured via vaccine and possibly draw a correlation between that
where the individual lived. First/third world countries.


##Question 10.
There were a couple of things which resonated with me after the talk. One is that doctors are very unlikely to share their data in the public domain. For me, that goes against the whole idea of
open source software in the programming world. Open source software allows for your code to be checked and improved by others. Or even looked at in different ways you didn't even think about. I feel like
if more data was in public domain that possible more research could surface because many doctors seeing the same data could each take something different from the data, or even improve or expand the data. 
The whole concept of hiding data seems backwards to me. Another thing that resonated was how much damage was done by the paper that claimed vaccines cause autism - especially after how much research
has surfaced that debunks the claims.
